TODO: Better description and documentation at README.md.

TODO: Make the `disabled` attribute prevent the element from being focused. The challenge is the interaction between `disabled` and `tabindex`, specially if the user (i.e. the developer using this component) changes those attributes dynamically.

TODO: Accessibility, [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) guidelines.

TODO: Find a way to make this component a [form-associated element](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#form-associated-element).

TODO: Add to a webcomponents gallery:

* https://github.com/tjvantoll/clock-face/blob/master/bower.json
* https://customelements.io/
* http://component.kitchen/components

TODO: rename the component to remove the `x-` prefix: http://webcomponents.org/articles/how-should-i-name-my-element/

TODO: Check the "Limitations" from README.md and try to address them.

TODO: Check [Web Components Best Practices](http://webcomponents.org/articles/web-components-best-practices/).
